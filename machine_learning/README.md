# 📘 Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine Learning (ML) is a subfield of AI that enables systems to learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.

## 🧪 Types of ML

### 1. Supervised Learning
- Input and labeled output
- Algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, SVM, etc.

### 2. Unsupervised Learning
- Input without labeled output
- Algorithms: K-Means Clustering, PCA, DBSCAN

### 3. Reinforcement Learning (Optional in this module)
- Agent learns by interacting with the environment

## 🔁 ML Workflow
1. Data Collection
2. Preprocessing
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Training
5. Evaluation
6. Deployment

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Python 3.11+
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
