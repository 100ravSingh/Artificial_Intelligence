# 📘 Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine Learning (ML) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that gives computers the ability to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. It powers many modern technologies like recommendation systems, fraud detection, and autonomous vehicles.

## 🧠 Core ML Paradigms

### 1. Supervised Learning
- **Definition**: Learn a function from input-output pairs.
- **Goal**: Predict labels for new data.
- **Examples**:
  - Regression: Predicting house prices
  - Classification: Email spam detection

### 2. Unsupervised Learning
- **Definition**: Discover patterns or structure in data without labels.
- **Goal**: Group or compress data.
- **Examples**:
  - Clustering: Customer segmentation
  - Dimensionality Reduction: PCA

### 3. Reinforcement Learning (RL)
- **Definition**: Learn by interacting with an environment.
- **Goal**: Maximize long-term reward through trial-and-error.
- **Examples**: Game playing agents, robotics

## 🔁 Typical ML Workflow

1. **Data Collection** – Gather raw data from various sources  
2. **Data Preprocessing** – Clean, transform, normalize  
3. **Feature Engineering** – Extract meaningful features  
4. **Model Selection** – Choose suitable algorithm  
5. **Model Training** – Fit the model to training data  
6. **Model Evaluation** – Assess performance on unseen data  
7. **Deployment** – Integrate model into production  
8. **Monitoring** – Track performance & retrain as needed
